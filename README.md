# AI-Driven Stock Investment Strategy  

## Overview  
This repository is for the **AI-Driven Stock Investment Strategy** project, which aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting high-performing stocks over a 3-month period. The project includes data preprocessing, model development, back-testing, and portfolio analysis, with a comparison to GPT-generated stock selections.  

## Project Status 
**Currently Underway** â€“ We are actively developing the machine learning model, preparing datasets, and refining our stock selection strategy. Regular updates will be posted as the project progresses.  

## Key Goals   
1. Develop a machine learning model to predict winning stocks.  
2. Back-test the model to evaluate its profitability.  
3. Construct an AI-driven stock portfolio and compare it against a GPT-based selection.
